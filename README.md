# FCC Projects
Hello, visitor! This repo is my homeworks commited to FCC's projects. You're more than welcome to contribute to any of my personal projects, as we can learn together and exchange any piece of knowledge.

## Summary
Each project is placed in folders related to FCC's curriculums. For now, the project tree gathers these works as sequenced below:

1. Responsive Web Design
	* Tribute Page;
	* Survey Form;
	* Landing Page (ongoing);
    * Technical Documentation (ongoing);

2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure
	* Ongoing...

## How to
It is advised to follow the common [Git basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) and clone any of my projects to start to contribute, but for quick start purposes, I recommend to mimic the steps as follows:

### Clonning and initializing FCC repository
First, configure your Git credentials locally by typing:
```Git
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "username@email.com"

```
Then, clone this repo by copy pasting this line - *bare with me, I highly suggest you use SSH to save some valuable time. More info [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/09/keeping-your-account-safe/) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for Github guys.*

```Git
git clone git@gitlab.com:krenak/FCC.git

```
Also, to mantain things organized, it's standard procedure to create a branch and work on that:
```Git
git branch new_branch
git checkout -b new_branch

```
For now, all projects are allocated in the first leg of FCC courses, especially in CSS part. Feel free to contribute, propose changes and enhancements of your taste and needs.

```$ cd FCC/```

After access the main folder, it will be easy to recognize the structure commented in the summary section.

## Getting in touch
In additions to these initial works, I maintain a small blog with miscellanea of data, discoveries and infos about coding and futher research in computational field.
