# FCC Projects
Hello, visitor! This repo is my homeworks commited to FCC's projects. You're more than welcome to contribute to any of my personal projects, as we can learn together and exchange any piece of knowledge.

## Summary
Each project is placed in folders related to FCC's curriculums. For now, the project tree gathers these works:

Responsive Web Design
	|
	|___Tribute Page;
	|
	|___Survey Form;
	|
	|___Landing Page;

## How to
It is advised to follow the common [Git basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) and clone any of my projects to start to contribute, but for quick start purposes, I recommend to mimic the steps as follows:

### Clonning and initializing FCC repository
All work done here is quite simple to reproduce, contribute and is farly light as well. Hence, is nice to have all files into a folder of your preference and sort of my projects locally in your machine. After that, the whole repository can be cloned into your folder by typing:

```git clone https://github.com/krenak/FCC.git```

For now, all projects are allocated in the first leg of FCC courses, especially in CSS part. Feel free to contribute, propose changes and enhancements of your taste and needs.

## Getting in touch
In additions to these initial work, I maintain a small blog with miscellany of data, discoveries and trivial infos about coding and futher research in computational field.
